                <h3>HISTORY OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h3>
                <h5>Computer engineering began in <mark>1939</mark> when John Vincent Atanasoff and
                Clifford Berry began developing the world's first electronic digital computer through 
                physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering.<br>
                John Vincent Atanasoff was once a physics and mathematics teacher for Iowa State University and Clifford Berry a former graduate under electrical engineering and physics.
                Together, they created the <mark>Atanasoff-Berry computer</mark>, also known as the ABC which took five years to complete.
                While the original ABC was dismantled and discarded in the 1940s a tribute was made to the late inventors, a replica of the ABC was made in 1997 where it took a team of researchers and engineers four years and $350,000 to build.

                <h3>HISTORY OF SOUTHERN LUZON STATE UNIVERSITY</h3>
                <h4>Southern Luzon State University (SLSU) started as Lucban Municipal Junior High School by virtue of <mark>Municipal Resolution No. 5 passed in April 1964</mark>.
                    Through the initiative of its founding president, <mark>Dr. Angelo Pe√±a</mark>, a letter signed by 257 petitioners seeking the establishment of a Municipal Junior High School was favorably received and recommended by the Municipal Council and then Mayor Hobart Dator.
                    The permit to operate was bestowed by Assistant Secretary of Education, Hon. Miguel Gaffud in July 1964. Since then, the Municipal Council allocated funds for its operations.
                    Due to its expanding student population, Municipal Resolution No. 18 series of 1966 effectively expropriated about 4.9 ha of land in Barrio Kulapi - a site which the Council initially allocated for the establishment of a public market - in favor of the Municipal High School.
                    This would then become the present site of the main campus of the university.
